Hi! 
I’m currently an AI Specialist at VPS Securities JSC, focusing on developing AI systems in the financial sector. Previously at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, I was a Research Assistant at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) under the supervision of Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq) and Dr. [Linh Ngo]([https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv). I have initiated and participated actively in several non-profit organizations, such as [DLBOOKVN](https://dlbookvn.gitlab.io/) and [VietAI](https://vietai.org) and [New Turing Institute](https://newturing.ai), aimed at promoting the AI community in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
