Hi! 
I’m currently an AI Specialist at VPS Securities JSC, focusing on developing AI systems in the financial sector. Previously at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, I was a Research Assistant at Data Science Lab under the supervision of Prof. Khoat Than and Dr. Ngo Van Linh. I have initiated and participated actively in several non-profit organizations, such as DLBOOKVN and VietAI, aimed at promoting the AI community in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
