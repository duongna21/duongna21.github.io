Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture for Vietnamese sequence labeling tasks including part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). We applied the model that is a combination of bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields, which rely on two sources of information about words: character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and pre-trained word embeddings learned from other unannotated corpora. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this work achieves state-of-the-art performances on both tasks 93.52% accuracy for POS tagging and 94.88% F1 for NER.
